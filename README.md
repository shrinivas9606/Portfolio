This project was made by Gautam Patil & Shrinivas Narhare at the GDSC Webathon hackathon dated on 31 May 2023.

We chose the problem statement of portfolio and made shrnivas's portfolio.
We created this website using DJANGO, DJANGO is a high level python framework for web development. Although django has multiple features and extensive use case scenarios, we only used url rerouting and template rendering for our website.

We created this FULLY FUNCTIONAL website in under 3 hours and deployed it on replit.com all the outgoing links with resume and social media outlinks are in working condition also the contact form is also responsive with the action mailto for sending successfull mail, replit is a free coding environment with which we were able to deploy our django project.

Replit repository <a href="https://replit.com/@B44ShrinivasNar/Portfolio-1">https://replit.com/@B44ShrinivasNar/Portfolio-1 </a>

All of the functionalities are in working condition and were made totally from scratch without any use of template. 
We weren't able to make our website fully responsive in under 3 hours so we tried are best to make it contempt with desktop user experience.
